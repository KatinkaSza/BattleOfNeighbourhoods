# BattleOfNeighbourhoods
Apllied Coursera Capstone Project

This project primarily helps people who have to move to Brussels, Belgium for professional reasons to find a suitable neighbourhood to live in. The analysis is intended to help future expats to find a suitable area more easily and to find a similar neighbourhood as they were used to before. For this purpose, a comparison is made between the different neighbourhoods in Brussels.
